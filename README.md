</p>

where I could learn how to create my own API using KTor
and I was also able to improve my skills developing layouts with jetpack Compose
That's why I want to share with you a brief video of what developed over these weeks of study,

technologies used:

* hilt - dependency injection
* 
* Room - local database and data cache
* 
* Paging 2 - partial data loading on demand
* 
* Palette - extract prominent colors from an image.
* 
* KTor - contribute Api from scratch
* 
* retrofit - consume the data from the API
